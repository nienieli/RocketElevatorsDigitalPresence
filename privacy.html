        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="text-center"><strong><b>Are you being watched when you ride?</b></strong>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Are you ever concerned about your privacy in an elevator? Do you think about the
            fact that there may be surveillance cameras recording your every move? Do you know your rights and do you
            even have any when you’re in such a public place? Here is your primer on elevators and your privacy:</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="text-center"><strong><b>Where you are likely to be recorded</b></strong>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Many elevators in public places such as office buildings, hotels, stadiums, and
            theaters are going to have video cameras in the elevators. It is perfectly legal and acceptable to record
            people coming and going, both for the safety of other visitors and the property. In some cases, it is
            essential.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="text-center"><strong><b>Video surveillance in elevators</b></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We’ve all seen leaked video footage of people in elevators. Often the images are
            of celebrities or athletes caught in the act, so to speak. Other times the footage is attached to a legal
            case and the video is being used as evidence. No doubt you’ve gotten into an elevator and spotted a camera
            pointed right at you. You might have wondered about the legality of security cameras in public places. While
            cameras are allowed – within reason – there are rules governing when and how such devices can be used.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><a
                href="http://codes.findlaw.com/us/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/18-usc-sect-2512.html"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-center"><u>According to FindLaw.com,</u></a> “Private
            business owners are
            generally allowed to install surveillance cameras, even hidden ones, in areas where they promote a
            legitimate business purpose. Cameras at entrances and check-out counters to spot possible theft are OK.”</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">That doesn’t mean building owners have free reign when it comes to recording the
            actions of people who walk through their doors. Privacy rights set strict guidelines that owners must
            follow. For instance, cameras can only be used to record video, <em><i>not audio</i></em>. Cameras are also
            not allowed in certain places, such as bathrooms or dressing rooms.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">According to FindLaw.com, “In order to avoid violating privacy laws, cameras in
            elevators must serve a legitimate business purpose and avoid intruding into a person&#8217;s reasonable
            expectation of privacy. For this reason, elevator security cameras are installed at a high vantage point and
            only record video. Recording audio without permission would be in violation of <a
                href="http://codes.findlaw.com/us/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/18-usc-sect-2512.html"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>federal wiretapping laws</u></a>.”</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="text-center"><strong><b>What about eavesdropping in an
                    elevator?</b></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We’ve all been on elevators with other people – maybe co-workers or even
            complete strangers – who don’t seem to mind airing their private business during the ride. It’s likely
            you’ve had these conversations, either with a friend or even someone on the phone. Does your right to
            privacy in elevators extend to eavesdropping?</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Well…not really.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">“In the most traditional sense, you have no privacy rights to prevent someone
            from overhearing you or eavesdropping on your conversation in an elevator – as long as that person is in the
            elevator with you,” according to FindLaw.com.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">While you can’t do anything about eavesdropping, the same laws apply when it
            comes to recording something you overhear in an elevator. It is still illegal for anyone to secretly record
            the conversation on his or her phone, for example. Selling the footage or audio is also illegal, although it
            always seems to happen when it comes to celebrities or athletes. In fact, if someone sells security footage
            taken in an elevator, they could be fined and prosecuted, which carries a sentence of up to 5 years, if
            convicted.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Elevators are out to the public so there is never any guarantee of your privacy.
            It’s a good idea to always remember that cameras could be on you at all times, so take appropriate caution.

                        We move billions of people a day but never lose sight of what each passenger wants and needs.
                        It’s been that way since we invented the world’s first safety elevator more than 40 years ago.
                        And it’s why we continue to set the standard for the industry we created.
